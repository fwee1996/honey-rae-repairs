//define route by wrap route in routes component from react router dom
//Dont need these inside return anymore: 
//{/* <TicketList/> */} 
// {/* <CustomerList/> */}
 // <EmployeeList/>

 //A Route is wrapped in Routes, Route has path and element
 //<Route path= "/tickets" element={<TicketList/>}/>
 //means when url at this path : /tickets
 //render this component <TicketList/>


// <Route path="/" element={<NavBar />} />
//"/" means:home , so always show navbar in the homepage, but we want for all pages how? 
//Wrap "/" Route as parent element around the other child  ROUTE.
//but rmbr RouteS is wrapped around all the above. And also remove / from "/tickets" 
//because no longer same level. now it is a child route of parent "/" home route 
//tell parent route where in relation to parent route path to render child route

//Outlet:
//whenever at/match one of these child routes below will render that element at NavBAr
//whenever find child route that matches will render the child element above NavBar!!!


//Purpose of  <Route index />
//is default child route bcs otherwise home will have welcome but when press ticket 
//or cust or employee their pages will render below each other on homepage

//so open up customer route make it parent route so can put stuff in
//<Route path="employees" element={<EmployeeList/>}/>-------to-------<<Route path="employees" element={<EmployeeList/>}/>  .....</Route>
//but the issue is now all cust render on each cust so need to make index route like with welcome!
//<Route path="customers">make index route here</Route>

//<Route path=":customerId"></Route>
//":customerId" is route parameter, so you can capture cust id--thats a key value pair cust id is key, 
//value is whatevewr id is rwendering like 1,2,3


//Authentication: so all <Routes> protected cant change unless you log in
